    <h3>Banana Bread Ingredients : </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
        <li><b>Baking soda</b>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
        <li><b>Butter</b>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Brown sugar</b>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><b>Bananas</b>: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>
